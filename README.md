# Emojify
1. Built &amp; trained a model in Keras for Facial Expression Recognition
2.  Test the model using real time images
3.  Classified each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0 = Angry, 1 = Happy, 2 = Neutral, 3 = Sad, 4 = Surprise)
4.  Used OpenCV to automatically detect faces in images and draw bounding boxes around them.
5.  Once we have trained, saved, and exported the CNN, we will directly serve the trained model to a web interface and perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data.
6.  Technology Used â€“ Python, OpenCV, CNN, Fer2013 Dataset.
