# Emojify
• Built &amp; trained a model in Keras for Facial Expression Recognition
• Test the model using real time images
• Classified each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0 =
Angry, 1 = Happy, 2 = Neutral, 3 = Sad, 4 = Surprise)
• Used OpenCV to automatically detect faces in images and draw bounding boxes around them.
• Once we have trained, saved, and exported the CNN, we will directly serve the trained model to a web
interface and perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data.
• Technology Used – Python, OpenCV, CNN, Fer2013 Dataset.
